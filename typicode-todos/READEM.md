# typicode-todos

### [link to live app](https://my-js-projects-37j9c.ondigitalocean.app/typicode-todos/index.html)

in this project I demonstrate the usage of fetch API to create simple http requests to 'jsonplaceholder' API.

like the 'shopping list' project, you can create and delete each task and also update it's status (frome complete to uncomplete by pressing each task)

The main goal of this project was to learn how to use fetch API tool with all kinds of methods (PUT, DELETE, GET , POST)
